These cronjobs are needed for daily mails.


Legend:

{ROOT}	= absolute file root
{USER}	= console (or vhost) user
{PATH}	= relative to user home

As root:

1. Set ownership of module configuration files to user:
	0 7 * * * chown {USER} {ROOT}{PATH}/config/modules/*
   Or (not tested but should do too):
	0 7 * * * chmod 775 {ROOT}{PATH}/config/modules/*


As user:

1. Run mail job.
	0 8 * * * cd {PATH}; ./job.php work-mission-mail-daily > logs/job.log
